# TODO-Evolution

TODO Evolution is a research project that measures the time and cost of building a simple to-do app both with and without various technologies, frameworks, and libraries, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

## Project Goals

- Implement identical todo application functionality across multiple technology stacks, with each implementation maintained in separate branches for clear comparison.
- Compare development time and complexity across different tech stacks
- Create a timeline and development road-log file that covers all planning, tech-stack selections, the time required to migrate to or implement specific technologies, their pros and cons, and more.

## Project Structure

### Repository Organization

- 'main' - Core documentation and project overview
- 'branches/' - Each branch represents a different tech stack implementation
  - 'vanilla-js' - Basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript implementation

## Project Features

### Core Features

- Create new todo items
- Mark todos as complete/incomplete
- Delete existing todos
- Store todos presistently
- Edit existing todos
- Filter todos by status (All/Active/Completed)

## Branch Documentation Standards

### Required Files for Each Branch

- `README.md` - Branch-specific documentation
  - Tech stack overview and versions
  - Setup instructions
  - Development environment requirements
  - Build and deployment procedures
  - Branch-specific notes or considerations

### Development Log (`DEVLOG.md`)

- Implementation timeline
- Time spent on each feature
- Challenges encountered and solutions
- Tech stack specific pros and cons
- Migration/implementation decisions

### Technical Documentation

- `docs/` directory containing:
  - Architecture diagrams

### Common Requirements

- All branches must implement the core features listed in Project Features
